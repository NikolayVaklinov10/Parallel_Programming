# Parallel_Programming
This project, will cover the fundamentals of parallel programming, from task parallelism to data parallelism. In particular, many familiar ideas from functional programming map perfectly to the data parallel paradigm. It will be shown the nuts and bolts how to effectively parallelize familiar collections operations, and how to build up to parallel collections, a production-ready data parallel collections library available in the Scala standard library. Throughout, these concepts will be applied several hands-on examples that analyze real-world data, such as popular algorithms like k-means clustering.
